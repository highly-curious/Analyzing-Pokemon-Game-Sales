# Analyzing-Pokemon-Game-Sales
NewForce C10 Capstone Project

# Summary
This capstone investigates how global Pokémon video game sales have evolved over time. By weaving together sales performance per title, reviews, and console sales we explore the franchise’s adaptive strategies and forecast its next chapter.

# Motivation
I have been a lifelong fan of the Pokémon franchise, but my enthusiasm has declined in recent years due to what I perceive as a drop in game quality. This project seeks to investigate whether this perceived decline is reflected in measurable performance, using units sold as a key indicator. 
By analyzing trends in sales alongside factors like development timelines, sentiment analysis, and promotional efforts, I aim to identify the underlying causes of this shift and assess how quality perception may be influencing the franchise’s commercial trajectory.

# Data Questions
Is there a measurable relationship between perceived quality decline and total units sold over time?
How does development time, or gaps between game releases influence launch sales and long-term performance?
How does sales performance compare between Mainline RPG titles, upgrades, remakes, and Spin-offs?
Do remake releases (e.g. FireRed & LeafGreen) follow sales patterns similar to their originals, and how do modern market conditions or nostalgia affect performance?
What effect do external promotions (i.e. movie releases, TV shows) have on game sales?
Have factors like inflation, unemployment, and regional GDP growth influenced Pokémon game sales over time?
Can we accurately forecast sales of upcoming Pokemon games: Legends Z-A, and Codename: Gaia using historical sales data and economic factors?
